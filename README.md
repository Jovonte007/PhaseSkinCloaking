# PhaseSkinCloaking

🛡️ PhaseSkinCloaking+

Now Powered by Bismuth Ferrite (BiFeO₃)

A cloak that doesn’t just react...
It remembers.
It adapts.
It thinks.

🚀 What’s New: The Brain of the Cloak

You’ve upgraded your cloaking system by integrating Bismuth Ferrite, turning PhaseSkinCloaking into PhaseSkinCloaking+—a surface with memory, magnetic intelligence, and optical reactivity.

> “Add intelligence to a surface... and you get stealth that thinks.”

🧠 Bismuth Ferrite (BiFeO₃): The Multiferroic Brain

Ferroelectric:
Stores electric polarization—acts like a memory capacitor.

Antiferromagnetic:
Responds to magnetic fields without becoming magnetized.
→ Perfect for stealth in signal-sensitive zones.

Photocatalytic & Optically Active:
Absorbs visible light; can shift bandgap under pressure or doping.
→ Adaptive to optical environments.

🔥 Extreme Operating Range:

Curie Temp: ~830°C

Néel Temp: ~370°C
→ Built to survive battlefield conditions.

🧬 Abilities Gained

🔒 Lock Cloak State:
Hold a cloaked form until a defined electric or magnetic field unlocks it.

🧲 Magnetic Signature Suppression:
Antiferromagnetic behavior allows it to exist in magnetic zones without detection.

🌈 Adaptive Optical Behavior:
Shifts response based on light and stress conditions—acts like an active camouflage system.
